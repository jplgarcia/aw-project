# Justifications for News Micro Frontend

## News Listing View
### Justification:
The news listing view presents a curated list of latest articles, blog posts, or announcements to keep users informed and engaged. By encapsulating this view within its own micro frontend for news content, teams can manage content aggregation, categorization, and presentation independently. It facilitates real-time updates, content syndication across platforms, and integration with social media channels to extend reach and drive traffic.

## News Data View
### Justification:
The news data view offers detailed insights and analytics on news consumption patterns, engagement metrics, and user feedback. Segregating this view within the news micro frontend enables teams to analyze audience demographics, track content performance, and optimize editorial strategies. It supports data-driven decision-making, content personalization, and monetization opportunities through targeted advertising and sponsored content partnerships.
