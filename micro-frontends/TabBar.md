## TabBar

### Justification
The TabBar is a fundamental UI element that allows users to navigate between different sections or views within an application. By dividing the TabBar into a micro frontend, teams can independently develop and maintain tab navigation logic, layout configurations, and visual styles. This modularization promotes flexibility in tab structure, enabling teams to easily add, remove, or rearrange tabs based on evolving user needs or feature requirements. Additionally, separating the TabBar into a micro frontend facilitates seamless integration with other components and enables efficient updates to tab functionalities without affecting the rest of the application. Moreover, this approach enhances maintainability, scalability, and code reusability, leading to improved development efficiency and overall user experience.

### Description
The TabBar is a UI component that presents multiple tabs or buttons for users to switch between different sections or views of the application. It typically appears at the top or bottom of the screen and provides users with an intuitive way to navigate through the application's content.
