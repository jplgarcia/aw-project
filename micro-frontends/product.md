# Justifications for Product Micro Frontend

## Product Info View
### Justification:
The product info view provides detailed information about a specific product, including descriptions, specifications, and pricing. Housing this view under a dedicated micro frontend streamlines product management processes, enabling teams to iterate on product features independently. It facilitates seamless integration with inventory systems, third-party APIs, and e-commerce platforms, enhancing the overall shopping experience for users.

## Product Information View
### Justification:
The product information view complements the product info view by offering additional details, such as user reviews, related products, and promotional offers. By organizing this view within the product micro frontend, teams can focus on enhancing product discovery and cross-selling capabilities. It enables dynamic content updates, A/B testing of promotional strategies, and integration with recommendation engines to drive sales and customer engagement.

## More Info View
### Justification:
The more info view serves as an extension of the product information view, providing supplementary information such as FAQs, warranty policies, and shipping details. Segregating this view within its own micro frontend promotes flexibility in content management and presentation. It facilitates collaboration between product management, marketing, and customer support teams to deliver comprehensive product information and address user inquiries effectively.
