## QRCodeScanner

### Justification
QRCode scanners enable users to quickly access information or perform actions by scanning QR codes. By separating the QRCode Scanner into a micro frontend, teams can focus on optimizing scanning algorithms, camera integration, and error handling independently. This modularization facilitates integration with device-specific features, enhances reliability across different devices, and allows for tailored user experiences based on scanning requirements.

### Description
QRCodeScanner components allow users to scan QR codes using their device's camera. They process the scanned data and perform actions such as opening links, displaying content, or adding items to a cart.
