## LoginPage

### Justification
The LoginPage serves as the entry point for users to access the application. By dividing it into a micro frontend, teams can focus on optimizing authentication processes, security measures, and user experience independently. This modularization streamlines development efforts, facilitates integration with authentication services, and allows for tailored solutions to meet specific security and usability requirements.

### Description
The LoginPage is where users authenticate themselves to access the application. It typically includes fields for entering usernames and passwords, options for password recovery or account registration, and security features such as CAPTCHA or two-factor authentication.
