## ProductPreview

### Justification
Product previews are crucial for showcasing key features, images, and details of products to users. Dividing ProductPreview into a micro frontend allows teams to iterate on product presentation, pricing information, and interactive elements independently. This modularization enhances flexibility in design, facilitates A/B testing of product layouts, and promotes seamless integration with product management systems or external APIs.

### Description
ProductPreview components display detailed information about products, including images, descriptions, prices, and ratings. They provide users with a preview of the product to help them make informed purchasing decisions.
