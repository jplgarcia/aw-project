## Navbar

### Justification
The Navbar serves as a crucial navigation component that provides users with access to various sections and functionalities of the application. By dividing the Navbar into a micro frontend, teams can independently develop and maintain navigation logic, menu structures, and visual styles. This modularization promotes flexibility in navigation design, facilitates customization of menu items based on user roles or preferences, and enhances scalability by allowing seamless integration with new features or modules. Additionally, separating the Navbar into a micro frontend enables teams to optimize performance, accessibility, and responsiveness independently, ensuring a consistent and intuitive navigation experience across different devices and screen sizes.

### Description
The Navbar is a persistent UI element that appears at the top of the application's interface. It typically contains links or buttons to navigate to different sections or pages of the application, along with branding elements such as logos or icons.
