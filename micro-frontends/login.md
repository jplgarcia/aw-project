# Justifications for Login Micro Frontend

## Login View
### Justification:
The login view is the entry point for users to access the application securely. By isolating the login view within its own micro frontend, it ensures that authentication processes are managed independently. This separation enhances security measures, simplifies authentication logic, and facilitates compliance with industry-standard security protocols such as OAuth or OpenID Connect.
