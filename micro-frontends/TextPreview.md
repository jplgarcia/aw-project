## TextPreview

### Justification
Text previews are crucial for providing users with a glimpse of content before they engage with it fully. By separating TextPreview into a micro frontend, teams can iterate on content presentation, formatting, and interactive features without impacting other parts of the application. This approach promotes customization, enhances performance, and enables seamless integration into various contexts within the application.

### Description
TextPreview components display short previews or excerpts of text content, such as articles, blog posts, or product descriptions. They provide users with a brief overview of the content to help them decide whether to read more.
