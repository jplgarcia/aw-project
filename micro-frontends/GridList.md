## GridList

### Justification
GridLists are commonly used to display structured data in a visually appealing manner. Dividing GridList into a micro frontend allows teams to focus on optimizing layout, responsiveness, and interaction patterns independently. This modularization enhances maintainability, promotes reusability of grid components across different parts of the application, and facilitates efficient updates to accommodate changing data structures or design requirements.

### Description
GridList components present data in a grid or list format, often used for displaying products, images, or articles. They organize information into rows and columns, allowing users to browse through content more easily.
