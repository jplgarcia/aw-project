## Featured

### Justification
Featured content often includes visually engaging elements such as slideshows or horizontal lists to highlight important information or promotions. Dividing the Featured component into a micro frontend enables teams to focus on designing dynamic layouts, implementing smooth transitions, and optimizing performance independently. This modularization enhances flexibility in content management, facilitates integration with content management systems or external APIs, and allows for seamless customization of featured content based on user preferences or marketing strategies.

### Description
Featured components showcase important content or promotions in visually appealing formats, such as slideshows or horizontal lists. They attract users' attention and highlight key information or offers to drive engagement and conversions.
