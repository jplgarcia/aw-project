## DropdownFilter

### Justification
Dropdown filters are essential for users to refine search results or navigate through large datasets efficiently. By separating DropdownFilter into a micro frontend, teams can implement custom filtering logic, design intuitive user interfaces, and optimize performance without affecting other components. This modularization enables seamless integration with diverse data sources and promotes consistency in filtering functionalities across the application.

### Description
Description: DropdownFilter components provide users with options to filter or narrow down search results or data sets based on specific criteria. They typically include dropdown menus or selection lists for users to choose filtering options.
