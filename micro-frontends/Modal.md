## Modal

### Justification
Modals are commonly used for various purposes such as displaying messages, forms, or interactive content. Dividing the Modal into a micro frontend enables teams to create reusable components that can be easily integrated into different parts of the application. This approach promotes code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and enhances flexibility in design and functionality.

### Description
Modals are pop-up dialog boxes that overlay the main content of the application. They are used to display important messages, gather user input through forms, or provide interactive features such as image galleries or video players.
