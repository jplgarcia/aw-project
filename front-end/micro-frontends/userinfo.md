# Justifications for User Micro Frontend

## User Info View
### Justification:
The user info view displays personalized information about the logged-in user, such as profile details, account settings, and preferences. Placing this view within a dedicated micro frontend allows for modular development and maintenance of user-related functionalities. It enables teams to implement user-specific features efficiently, ensure data privacy and access controls, and tailor the user experience based on individual preferences.
