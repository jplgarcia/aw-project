# Justifications for Stats Micro Frontend

## Positive Stats View
### Justification:
The positive stats view presents key performance indicators (KPIs) and success metrics related to user activity, product adoption, and revenue growth. By housing this view within its own micro frontend for statistics, teams can focus on visualizing data trends, conducting A/B tests, and identifying areas for optimization. It facilitates executive dashboards, stakeholder reporting, and strategic planning initiatives to drive business growth and competitive advantage.

## Negative Stats View
### Justification:
The negative stats view highlights areas of concern or performance bottlenecks that require attention and remediation. Placing this view within the stats micro frontend enables teams to monitor error rates, downtime incidents, and user complaints effectively. It supports proactive issue resolution, root cause analysis, and continuous improvement efforts to enhance system reliability, user satisfaction, and overall business resilience.
